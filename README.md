## Ecommerce Marketing Analytics Dashboard with Kafka, Spark & Tableau

This project is aimed towards building a marketing analytics dashboard to visualize key performance metrics (open rates, click-through rates, purchases) associated with multi-channel marketing campaigns (email, web push, mobile push, SMS) for e-commerce companies.

**Data Source:** E-commerce Multichannel Direct Messaging Dataset (full dataset)

**Technologies:**

* **Apache Kafka:** Distributed streaming platform for ingesting message data.
* **Apache Spark Streaming:** Framework for processing real-time data streams using Spark.
* **Apache HDFS:** Distributed file system for storing processed data.
* **Tableau:** Data visualization tool for creating interactive dashboards.

**Benefits:**

* Gain valuable insights into campaign performance for data-driven decision making.
* Scalable to handle large volumes of data.
* Flexible system that can be extended to integrate with other marketing data sources and machine learning models.

**Project Scope:**

This project focuses on building a marketing analytics pipeline with PySpark Streaming and storing processed data in HDFS for visualization with a separate tool. Implementing a fully integrated dashboard with real-time data refreshes might require additional development depending on the chosen visualization tool's capabilities.
